# ScriptableBase

This is a set of scripts that implement a framework for game developing in Unity based on scriptable objects featuring:

* ScriptableObject variables with the classic UseConstant-UseVariable pattern.
* An event system that hooks up with the other features for events like variable value changes.
* Localization with json integration.

There is a sample scene with some scripts that showcase the most basic functionality of the framework that can be found at https://github.com/varguiniano/ScriptableBaseSample.

Of course I'm not reinventing the wheel. This is a set of tools that I created to use it on my personal projects, feel free to use it if you find it useful.
